# Job Application Challenge

Using jQuery or vanilla JS you will display each 'USER' in a table. When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'. You have full freedom in how you accomplish the above objectives. You also have full freedom as far as design is concerned. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task. Once completed, please upload your code to a Github repo and send us the link via Indeed chat.

## Area for Improvements

No Middleware nor Statemanagement systems in place aside from React's useState property which I prefer not using due to prop drilling.

Removal of React framework in favor of PURE javascript as the challenge requested but due to time constraints and the boilerplate required for Vanilla JS taking up too much time for the coding aspect I didn't foresee having the necessary time to accomplish the given task.
